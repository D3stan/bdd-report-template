The Quarkdown flavor introduces table captions, which can be set by adding a line right under the table. The content is wrapped between double quotes, single quotes or parentheses, exactly like the image *title* attribute.

```
| Country | Capital |
|---------|---------|
| England | London  |
| Italy   | Rome    |
| France  | Paris   |
"Capitals of Europe"
```

<img width="550" alt="Result" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7557a9cf-26bb-4273-9736-1a21cee12040">

&nbsp;

The caption must be situated immediately next to the table, on a new line. The following example renders a paragraph instead of a caption:

```
| Country | Capital |
|---------|---------|
| England | London  |
| Italy   | Rome    |
| France  | Paris   |

"Capitals of Europe"
```

<img width="550" alt="Wrong" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bfcdbbe-e2bb-4a2d-9a77-9ec0c9cf9fb0">

&nbsp;

Tables can be **numbered**: see [Numbering](numbering) for further information.
