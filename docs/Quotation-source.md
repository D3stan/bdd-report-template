Quarkdown allows a blockquote to have a citation source.

In general, if the quote ends with a single-item unordered list, that list item is set as the citation source. Hence, the source can be specified using any of the supported unordered list bullets: `-`, `*`, `+`, although it's suggested to use `-`.

```
> To be, or not to be, that is the question.
> - William Shakespeare
```

The layout and aesthetics are handled by the current theme.

The source may contain inline content (including function calls):

```
> Failure's not an option. It's just a step.
> - Dwayne **The Rock** Johnson
```

Any kind of blockquote may have a source:

```
>> You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
>> - Wayne Gretzky
> - Michael Scott
```
