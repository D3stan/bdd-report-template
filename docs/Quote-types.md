If a blockquote begins by `Tip:`, `Note:`, `Warning:` or `Important:`, it is assigned the given type. Said prefix is stripped off and the element is styled accordingly.

```
> Tip: some useful information
```

If the document's locale is set via [`.doclang`](document-metadata) and the locale is supported, a localized prefix is displayed and styled accordingly to the current layout theme.
